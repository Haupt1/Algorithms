# (1) Base-10 representations are called decimal representations.
# (2) Base-2 representations are called binary representations.
# (3) Base-8 representations are called octal representations.
# (4) Base-16 representations are called hexadecimal representations.
# (5) Base-60 representations are called sexagesimal representations.

# A B C D E F for
# 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15 respectively.


# (1) (1231)10 is the decimal representation of 1231.
# (2) (117)8 is the octal representation of 79 because 1 x 8 ** 2 + 1 x 8 ** 1 + 7 x 8 ** 0 = 79.
# (3) (4D)16 is the hexadecimal representation of 77 because 4 x 16 ** 1 + 13 x 16 ** 0 = 77.


#Find the binary, octal and hexadecimal expansions of 1231.

#find the values of
# (a) (1101001)2;
# (b) (156)8;
# (c) (74)16;
